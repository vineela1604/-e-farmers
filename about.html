         <h6 style="padding: 0px 30px;text-align:justify;font-size:15px;line-height: 1.5em;"> farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. 
           The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, 
           vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as 
           a laborer on land owned by others, but in most developed economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, 
           while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in other older definitions
            a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land or crops or raises animals 
            (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention.Over half a billion farmers are smallholders,
             most of whom are in developing countries, and who economically support almost two billion people.
             Globally, women constitute more than 40% of agricultural employees.</h6>
             <h6 style="padding:0px 30px;text-align:justify;font-size:15px;line-height: 1.5em;">The current concept of a farmers' market is similar to past concepts, but different in
                  relation to other forms as aspects of consumer retailing, overall, continue to shift over time.
                  Similar forms existed before the Industrial Age, but often formed part of broader markets, where suppliers
                    of food and other goods gathered to retail their wares. Trading posts began in 1930s, a shift toward retailers who sold others'
                    products more than their own. General stores and grocery stores continued that specialization trend in retailing, optimizing the consumer experience,
                    while abstracting it further from production and from production's growing complexities.</h6>
                  <h6  style="padding:0px 30px;text-align:justify;font-size:15px;line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Modern industrial food production's advantages over prior methods depend largely on modern, cheap, fast transport and limited product variability.
                  But transport costs and delays cannot be eliminated. So where distance strained industrial suppliers' reach, where consumers had strong preference for local variety,
                  farmers' markets remained competitive with other forms of food retail. Starting in the mid-2000s, consumer demand for foods that are fresher (spend less time in transit)
                    and for foods with more varietyâ€”has led to growth of farmers' markets as a food-retailing mechanism.</h6>

          E-market for farmers can offer farmers increased profit over selling to wholesalers, food processors, or large grocery firms.
           By selling directly to consumers, produce often needs less transport, less handling, less refrigeration and less time in storage. 
           By selling in an outdoor market, the cost of land, buildings, lighting and air-conditioning is also reduced or eliminated.
            Farmers may also retain profit on produce not sold to consumers, by selling the excess to canneries 
          and other food-processing firms. At the market, farmers can retain the full premium for part of their produce, instead of only a processor's wholesale price for the entire lot.
           However, other economists say "there are relatively few benefits in terms of energy efficiency, quality or cost ... fun though they are, are not good economic models.
          Some farmers prefer the simplicity, immediacy, transparency and independence of selling direct to consumers.
           One method noted by the special interest group Food Empowerment Project promotes community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs).
            In this scheme, consumers pay farms seasonally or monthly to receive weekly or biweekly boxes of produce. Alternatively, they may be required to pay
             for an entire season's worth of produce in advance of the growing season. In either case, consumers risk losing their money if there is a crop failure.</h6>
         
       <h4 style="padding:0px 30px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.5em;" >To Consumers</h4>
      <h6 style="padding:0px 30px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.5em;">To consumers
        Some consumers may favor E-market for Farmers for the perceived:
        <ul>
        <li>Reduced overhead: driving, parking, etc.</li>
        <li>Fresher foods</li>
        <li>Seasonal foods</li>
       <li> Healthier foods</li>
        <li>A better variety of foods, e.g.: organic foods, pasture-raised meats, free-range eggs and poultry,
         handmade farmstead cheeses, heirloom produce heritage
         breeds of meat and many less transport-immune cultivars disfavored by large grocers.
       <li>A place to meet neighbors, chat, etc.</li>
        <li>A place to enjoy an outdoor walk while getting needed groceries.</li></ul>
        Evidence seems to show that overall prices at a typical farmers' market are lower than prices at a 
        supermarket because the process of production is more concise; there is less distance to travel
         and fewer middlemen. </h6>
